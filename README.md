# About Me 👋
Hi! I’m Benyamen Safwat, an electronics and digital design enthusiast with a passion for creating efficient, elegant, and high-performance digital systems. Over the years, I’ve worked on a variety of projects, from bus interfaces and communication modules to arithmetic accelerators and multipliers. I love taking a concept from an idea to a fully functional implementation, whether it’s writing RTL code 💻, creating testbenches 🧪, or analyzing performance 📊.

I also enjoy explaining my work, so many projects include YouTube videos 🎥 where I walk through the concepts and implementation details. This portfolio is my way of sharing both the technical depth and the thought process behind each project.

# Welcome to My Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my portfolio, a journey through the projects I’ve worked on! Each repository contains a collection of projects, and every project tells its own story. Inside, you’ll find a README 📄 that explains the topic in detail—sometimes even with a YouTube video 🎥 where I walk you through it.

Beyond the explanations, each project includes all the files that bring it to life: RTL code 💻, testbenches 🧪, performance reports 📊, and more.

Here are some of the projects you can explore:

- [Clock Dividers (1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5)](#)
- [Glitch Free Clock MUX](#)
- [Synchronous and Asynchronous FIFO](#)
- [UART Transmitter and Receiver Module](#)
- [SPI Master and Slave Modules](#)
- [I2C Master and Slave Modules](#)
- [APB Requester/Completer Bus Modules](#)
- [AXI4-Lite Slave Interface](#)
- [AHB Slave & Master Modules](#)
- [Wishbone Bus Interface](#)
- [Radix-4 Multiplier (Modified Booth Algorithm)](#)

> [!💡TIP]
> Start by reading the project README to understand the objectives and highlights, then explore the code and reports for implementation details. Videos can provide a quick walkthrough if you prefer a visual explanation.
