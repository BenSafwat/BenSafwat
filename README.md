# About Me 👋
Hi! I’m Benyamen Safwat, an electronics CHIP design enthusiast passionate about creating efficient, elegant, and high-performance digital and analog systems. Over the years, I’ve tackled a wide range of projects, from bus interfaces and communication modules to arithmetic accelerators. I enjoy taking a concept from idea to reality—writing RTL code 💻, building testbenches 🧪, analyzing performance 📊, designing analog layouts, and handling full physical implementation from synthesis to GDS. My goal is always to combine technical depth with clean, and functional design.

I also enjoy explaining my work, so many projects include YouTube videos 🎥 where I walk you through the concepts and implementation details. This portfolio is my way of sharing both the technical depth and the thought process behind each project.

# Welcome to My Portfolio 🚀

 A journey through the projects I’ve worked on! Each repository contains a collection of projects, and every project tells its own story. Inside each project, you’ll find a README 📄 that explains the topic in detail, sometimes even with a YouTube video 🎥 where I walk you through it.

Beyond the explanations, each project includes all the files that bring it to life: RTL code 💻, testbenches 🧪, performance reports 📊, and more.

Here are some of the projects you can explore:
